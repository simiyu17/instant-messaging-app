### Instant Messaging App

## How to run
- Easy way of running both back-end and frond-end is to use docker. Change directory to this directory (directory containing this README.md file).
- For first time run `docker-compose up -d --build`. This command will build both API and client and start them in docker. This might take a few minutes. 
- Open your browser to go to `http://localhost:4200/`.
